Created for Data Visualization course. This dashboard enables you to:

- choose specific type of wine to be presented on the dashboard
- get the average price, rating and number of different wines of a chosen type
- search through the table, filter on specific attributes
- inspect average price of wine for each production year and country, by clicking on the plot get the information about the most expensive wine from that time and country
- check the influence of rating on price, study table with price/rating ratio
- observe where the wines come from on a world map and get the top 5 most frequent production regions

**REMARK** - Unfortunately there is a problem with the rnaturalearth library, which is why the world map does not load, but it works in RStudio.
